# Kickstarting with Excel
An Analysis of a Kickstarter Campagins that compares different variables to facilitate informed decision making on possible outcomes for client's projected goals
## Overview of Project
Coming close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time,Louiseâ€™s play Fever is to be evaluated using new parameters.Louise wants to know how different campaigns compared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the data already provided, we are to perform an analysis by visualizing the campaign outcomes based on their goals for funding and their launch date.
### Purpose
To evaluate how campaign outcomes and their launch dates vary within the Kickstarter Campagins.Louise wishes to compare this data with those of other projects to determine vital paramters in their campagin strategies to possibly fund other future projects successfully.
### Analysis and Challenges
## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Given the data above,campagins were more successful towards the month of May(peak) and begins slowly to decline towards the end of the year. The failed campagins were more steady have a spike in november. Canceled campagins remain constant throughout the years with no major spike or dips.
## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

This above graph emphasize on the plays subcategory wthin the theater category. Total number of campagins were counted with SUM function, pre-sorted based on specified parameters of campagins on their outcomes and goals.There were virtually no canceled plays,As goals increased from less 1000 to 34999 the possibility of of successful campagins decreased.The greatest success rates is displayed at goals less than 1000 and the lowest success rates can be seen for goals of 45,000-49999.
### How Goals was grouped
- Less than 1000
- 1000 to 4999
- 5000 to 9999
- 10000 to 14999
- 15000 to 19999
- 20000 to 24999
- 30000 to 34999
- 35000 to 39999
- 40000 to 44999
- 45000 to 49999
- Greater than 50000
### Challenges and difficulties Encountered
One Challenge I encountered was changing the launch date to months on the pivot table. My version of excel automatically included other subcategories (Quarter, Year)
# Results
## What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- The best time to launch a theatrical campagin would be the begininng of the year with highest chances of success in the month of May
- To minimize chance of failed campagins avoid running campagin at the end of year .
# What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
It can be conclude that as the fund raising goals increase so will the probality of failed campagins. Cilent should avoid having a high campagin goals ($25,000 or more) as the probability of failed campagins outway the successful campagins. To have greater chance of successful campagins the goal limit should be less than 1000.
# Limitations of Dataset
With such limited data,The need for variables within the data set will help to understand the logic behind the failures in some events displayed. Depending on different variables like marketing/ advertising/ quality of production/ and market conditions. Not accounting for so many variables can drastically cause changes to specified areas.
# What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
- A table displaying the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled theater events based on the lunch date and pivot chart.
- Other line charts like stacked line chart that gives us the cumulative at each point
- A table summerizing the period on which every event was succesfully completed.
- A graph representing all the parent categories and the number of the successful outcome.
